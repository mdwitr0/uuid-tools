This is a simple and convenient service for quick UUID generation. Personally for me, it has become an indispensable tool in work, so I decided to share it with others.

The service itself is written in `React` and `TypeScript`, and uses `Next.js` for server-side rendering. `Mantine` is used as a UI framework.

The service is available at: [https://www.uuid.tools](https://www.uuid.tools).
